// Q8: In a single statement declare a variable and assign a number to it. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far—no quotes and no initial number—so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
// ans: var num = 3;

// Q9: In a single statement declare a variable and assign to it the sum of 2 other variables. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
// ans: var total = cost + profit;

// Q10: Rewrite this statement so the variable can be used in a math operation.
// var num = "9";
// ans: var num = 9;

// Q11: Assign the sum of 2 numbers to a variable, which hasn't been declared beforehand. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
// ans: var sum = 1 + 1;

// Q12: In one statement declare a variable. In a second statement assign it the sum of 2 numbers. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
// ans: var total;
//      total = 1 + 1;

// ans: num total;
//      total = 1 + 1;

// Q18: In the first statement declare a variable and assign it a number. In the second statement, change the value of the variable by adding it together with a number.
// ans: var friends = 30;
//      friends = friends + 10;
